## About The Project

This is React app that uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com), [Express Framework](https://expressjs.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [React Framework](https://reactjs.org) to provide a company recruitment preparation platform for students. It has features like discussion forum, quiz portal, aptitude practice videos and dashboard for latest placement updates from companies, to help students prepare for company recruitment drives. It also makes use of [HackerEarth API](https://www.hackerearth.com/docs/wiki/developers/v3/) to simulate a functional online code compiler with support for C, C++, Java and Python Languages.

### Built With

This project is entirely built with the following components and languages:

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
- [Express Framework](https://expressjs.com/)
- [React Framework](https://reactjs.org)
- [Node.js Runtime](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [HackerEarth API](https://www.hackerearth.com/docs/wiki/developers/v3/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions in order to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Node.js>=10 and MongoDB>=4.2 should be installed. After installation, check Node.js version, and MongoDB daemon status using

```sh
node --version
service mongod status
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```git
git clone https://github.com/vijethph/PlacementCell.git
```

2. Open the downloaded folder

```sh
cd PlacementCell
```

3. Modify the MongoDB URI in `server.ts` file inside `src` folder as per your DB configuration. Sign up for HackerEarth, retrieve an API key, and put it in `codes.ts` file inside `src/routes` folder. Then import the required dependencies in both of these folders: `src` and `client`, using

```sh
npm install
```

4. Run the program using

```sh
npm run dev
```


The app should be running in `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

Another way to install this app is to use Docker Compose. Run this command to start the app:
```
docker-compose up
```
This will run the app at http://localhost:3000, which can be seen in your browser.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Once the app starts, you can create an account in `Register` page, and then login as student to find the various features of this project. Optionally, you can import the companies details using the MongoDB init script named `mongoDBSetup.js` in project folder, using the command `mongo MONGODB_URI mongoDBSetup.js`. You can watch practice videos, have some discussion with your peers, and test yourself in quiz.

You can also use the code compiler and try to improve your programming skills. You can view the recruitment updates of companies in `Companies` dashboard.
